# Ice-Cream-Shoppe
Ice Cream Shoppe program indicates how many cartons of ice cream were used in total
Based on the selected scoop's radius sizes, and the number of scoops given:

The user is prompted to enter:
1) Radius of the first scooper
2) Radius of the second scooper
3) Radius of the ice cream carton
4) Height of the ice cream carton
5) Then they are prompted if they want more ice cream
6) And how many scoops of each radius size they would like

The program continues until the user indicates they don't want more ice cream
The program then prints how many total cartons of ice cream they used based on the number of scoops of each type
